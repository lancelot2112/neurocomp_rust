# 108: A world and a mind, with every reward the mind's own

**Question.** Can the network learn when to listen, when to speak and when to reach, when nobody
tells it what phase it is in or what was right? Here every reward comes from its own innate
valuations of what it senses, and nothing outside hands it credit.

**Why.** In experiment 107 the driver did more than set up the task:
- it decided what a trial was and when the network listened or spoke;
- it gave a reward when a planned word matched the teacher's;
- it ended episodes and switched learning off at test.

Each of those was a decision the network should make or a signal it should not get. Training
plateaued: past 1,000 trials words planned right stayed at about 49%, and telling with the book
closed at about 5%. That points at the setup, not the amount of training.

## The split

**The world** (`src/program/world.rs`).
- **The body.** A vocal tract and a mouse carry out commands. A command that matches no motor
  pattern does nothing.
- **The senses.** Each step reports:
  - the eye: the screen, meaning the cursors, an open book's word, and what moved;
  - the ear: its own voice, someone else's, or silence;
  - touch: the hand's motion, a vibration over a book, an edge where a neighbour differs;
  - presence: someone there and attending, and whether they smile.
- **The people respond only to what they can observe.**
  - A caregiver, there half the time in speech play, answers a sound said aloud with the same
    sound, once the child pauses.
  - A teacher runs the lesson:
    - opens their book on screen and reads it aloud;
    - pauses, then asks "now read it" or "now tell it";
    - waits, showing how to open the book on their own copy;
    - then does the task or listens while the child does it;
    - listening, smiles at a right word said aloud and says the right word after a wrong one;
    - if the child chimes in while the teacher is talking, a right next word gets a smile.
- **No rewards.** A smile is a sight like any other.
- **An event log** records each step (what was said and by whom, what was wanted) for an observer
  outside both.

**The genome** (`Body`) gives the mind:
- the body's motor primitives: the vocal tract's syllables and the hand's moves, which brainstem
  pattern generators can produce spontaneously;
- the presence sense's innate tuning to a smile.

**The mind** (`src/program/mind.rs`, with the always-completing index in `src/program/index_hc.rs`)
runs one pipeline every step, `step(senses) -> acts`:
1. **Learn what came.** The columns learn from their last state what the effectors' senses
   received: the hand's touch if it acted, else the ear. The motor areas learn each act's result,
   with no babbling phase handed the world's answers.
2. **One hippocampal step over the whole cortical state.** The input is every sensing area's
   cells, sensed or imagined; nobody tells the hippocampus what was heard.
   - An input that changed is attention outward: acetylcholine rises and the state is stored.
   - The voice's efference copy marks a sound as its own: it is represented, not stored.
   - A new state that came from neither is attention turned inward: acetylcholine falls.
   - An unchanged state is nothing new, so the offer holds.
3. **Sense.** Every column, the motion stream, the mirror, the association columns, and the
   cerebellum. The relay's mix is now only the cortex's expectation (for surprise); nothing routes
   it to the voice.
4. **Value what came.** These innate valuations are the only dopamine:
   - *own effect:* after its own act, as surprising as the senses find what came;
   - *response:* someone present, and a sound from outside within two steps of its own sound
     said aloud;
   - *smile:* an innately recognised pattern in the presence sense;
   - *effort:* every act costs a little.
5. **Loops grow with the cortex** (Alexander, DeLong & Strick 1986).
   - **Column loops.** Every column with a layer 5, sensory or association, gets its own loop
     through the basal ganglia when it is created. The striatum sees each column's activity as
     its own group.
   - **A column's goal is learned.** Its layer 5 offers the fired cell whose output has been
     worth most when followed. That worth is learned from the dopamine that follows: the TD error
     reaches the goal cells followed in the last four steps.
   - **Taking a goal in.** The column's loop takes its goal in or not. An association column's
     loop can also gate its content into working memory (PBWM's stripes).
   - **Motor loops.** Each motor area's loop chooses among the goals taken in that it can plan,
     plus its own spontaneously active primitive (one per step). Its motor gate then releases the
     choice to the body or withholds it. Withheld, it is imagined: the forward model's result
     comes back top-down at the next step, to the cortex and to the hippocampus alike.

The mind never knows it is being tested and never stops learning. `examples/lessons.rs` is the
curriculum (speech play, mouse play, lessons) and the observer.
