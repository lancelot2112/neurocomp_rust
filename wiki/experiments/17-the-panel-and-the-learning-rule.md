# 17. The panel, and a learning rule that learns pairs

## The question

The stated goal (2026-10-17): **evolve general agents using bit math**, agents that can operate
a computer and converse, produced by evolution over bit-vector networks. No floats, no
gradient-trained network as the agent; a pretrained model may appear only as a teacher or as
part of the world. After runs 29 and 30, what limits the current path, and what should change?

## The panel

Four subagents, each reading the code, `CLAUDE.md`, the wiki and the run logs. They worked
read-only and wrote a memo from one angle each, then read the others' memos and answered them.
The memos are kept in [`../panel/`](../panel/):

| Angle | Round 1 | Round 2 |
|---|---|---|
| The primitives and the learning rules | [1-architecture](../panel/1-architecture.md) | [1-architecture-r2](../panel/1-architecture-r2.md) |
| The evolutionary search and the curriculum | [2-evolution](../panel/2-evolution.md) | [2-evolution-r2](../panel/2-evolution-r2.md) |
| The world, the body and the interface | [3-world](../panel/3-world.md) | [3-world-r2](../panel/3-world-r2.md) |
| Learning theory, neuroscience and scale | [4-theory](../panel/4-theory.md) | [4-theory-r2](../panel/4-theory-r2.md) |

### Where all four agreed

**The diagnosis.** The substrate can represent an agent: a kernel is a threshold unit with
binary weights, and AND-NOT and XOR make it universal. What it could not do is learn arbitrary
input-to-output maps within a lifetime, and evolution cannot supply what the runtime cannot do.
Four reasons:
1. **A kernel's output was fixed at birth.** A pairing made once, by chance, could never be
   corrected (the reader of experiment 16: eight glyph kernels, all writing token 3).
2. **Credit reached populations, not kernels.** A gate says when a whole population learns, not
   which kernel's act caused what followed.
3. **The learning rule was not in the genome.** Evolution could tune the runtime's rules (rates,
   gates) but not change them.
4. **Selection rewarded skills, not learning.** Ladders pay for what can be built in, so
   evolution builds it in. Runs 29 and 30 move fast on such rungs, then stall where a code must
   be learned within the lifetime. The variance measurement after run 20 found no difference
   between genomes on echo2 and cycle1 beyond noise.

**Feasibility.** Running a brain-sparse agent in real time would fit on one workstation, within
an order of magnitude or two (a rough estimate). Evolving its knowledge would not, by many
orders. Evolution contributes a few bits a generation; it can find a learner, and the learner
must do the rest from experience. The only reachable route is meta-learning: evolve the learner
on short, varied, cheap tasks, then check that it keeps learning in long lifetimes.

**Methodology.** Every run in [island-runs](../island-runs.md) is a single evolutionary seed,
each stacking one switch on the run before, so conclusions such as "size classes help" are
hints, not results. From now on a new mechanism is compared on 3 evolutionary seeds.

### What changed in round 2

- **The fixed body.** Memo 3 defended it (anatomy is fixed, as keyboards and fonts are); memo 4
  argued it lets evolution build in what should be learned. All four settled on: keep the body
  fixed; draw every mapping the agent must use (what glyphs mean, which act pays, facts,
  vocabulary) afresh each lifetime; score on held-out content; and add a learning-slope case.
  Memo 3 added an observer rule: a rung counts only on worlds with permuted mappings.
- **Memo 2 withdrew a red flag.** It had blamed the fixed body for run 30's zeros on feel-100;
  run 29 shows the same zeros without a fixed body. (Memo 4's round 2 still cites the flag; the
  withdrawal stands.)
- **Memos 1 and 2 changed the order.** They had wanted writable masks first. All four agreed on
  one mechanism at three levels, smallest first, each shown by hand before the next:
  1. a fixed three-factor output rule (eligibility, a modulator, an output move, and death for
     wrong pairings);
  2. the rule's conditions as a gene, seeded with that rule, so evolution varies a working rule;
  3. masks as writable channels, so a rule can be any circuit (the largest search space, last).
- **Memo 2 put the substrate ahead of the noise floor**, its own first demand, since no number of
  replicate seeds turns zero signal into a gradient.
- **The first gate:** a paired-associate capacity curve (memo 1's), scored at two lifetime
  lengths, with a blind control and a hand-written table as a ceiling. Next-byte prediction
  against an n-gram is the decisive later gate for language. A byte terminal and dialogue worlds
  come after that.

## What was done, and the numbers

1. **The capacity curve** (`examples/pairscheck`, `runs/checks/pairscheck-capacity.txt`). N
   glyph-to-token pairs (2, 8, 32, 128), glyphs drawn each lifetime, the teacher on six tokens in
   eight, scored by copy (goal 100) on 24 worlds at 400 and 3,200 trials, under run 30's body. A
   lookup table written in the harness scores 148 to 243 and gains with experience. Every network
   scores about 0 beyond N = 2: run 30's best reading, generalist and recall genomes, and the
   hand-made echo genome. **The gap was confirmed.**
2. **The three-factor output rule** (`EdgeSpec::elig`; [experiment 16](16-reward-learning-and-the-genome.md)).
   A kernel that fired k steps ago is checked while its gate is open, against what its
   destination holds then. Right, it counts up; wrong, an output line moves and it counts down;
   wrong at 0, it dies and its input is free for a new birth.
   - **With a right target** (each token heard like its voice code, so one wire echoes the
     teacher exactly), a wire plus a reader learns 128 pairs: copy 195 at N = 128 over 3,200
     trials, against the lookup's 237; 143 to 147 at 400 trials; the same on 24 other worlds. The
     same reader without the rule scores 0. **The first network to learn arbitrary pairs in a
     lifetime.**
   - **With the hand-made genome's own listener as the target**, copy reaches only 26: the reader
     learns, but only the 3 or 4 tokens that listener can echo.
3. **Rule tables** (`EdgeSpec::rule`, 16 bits; seed `0x9405` is the runtime's own rules;
   `runs/checks/pairscheck-rules.txt`). The seed reproduces every number exactly.
   - **Death is what fixes wrong pairings:** without the output move the reader scores the same.
   - **Without death** it learns faster in short lifetimes (222 at N = 32, above the lookup's 213)
     and forgets in long ones (52 at N = 8 over 3,200 trials).
   - **Anti-Hebbian firing** breaks learning.
4. **Run 30** (a fixed body, 8-line one-word codes; stopped at 266): 24 rung moves, 7 past rungs
   run 29 never passed (recall to lag16; screen glow and torch; the maze feel-100 and feel;
   prediction cycle1-100 and cycle1; shapes feel, repeat and win-stay). Reading sat on echo2q all
   run.
5. **Run 31** (run 30 with `ISL_ELIG=1` and `ISL_PAIRS=1`, reading's pairs8 and pairs32 rungs
   after echo2q): started 9:09 PM ET. Reading passed echo2q at 24 and is on pairs8.

6. **The 3-seed pairs test** ([`runs/pairs-test/README.md`](../../runs/pairs-test/README.md)):
   reading alone on pairs8 > pairs32 > pairs128, 200 generations, 3 seeds, three arms (no rule,
   the rule, the rule as a table). No arm with the rule passed pairs8. The one pass, without the
   rule, was an echo wire that the island's held-out check scored copy 340 to 548 on pairs8 and
   pairs32, while examples/pairscheck and a fresh-world lesion score it at about 0: the island
   rungs leak echo into copy. The test means nothing until that is fixed.
7. **Triggers** (`EdgeSpec::trigger`, `ISL_TRIGGERS=1`, one popcount and a compare each): a
   population's kernels count agreeing lines (at least, the default), their silent lines (at
   most), agreeing lines up to halfway between threshold and full (a band), or agreeing lines less
   those on outside the mask in its words (the whole tile, an XOR). Built and unit-tested; not yet
   checked on a task.

## What it means, and what is next

The panel's central gap, learning an arbitrary map within a lifetime, is closed by hand for the
first time, with three local bit operations: an age count, a gate, and death. Two things remain:
- **The target.** The rule learns whatever the destination holds when the check comes; reading
  needs a listener that echoes every token. Under the fixed body that is something evolution
  can build in.
- **Evolution.** Does evolution find the rule's timing in run 31, and improve on the seed table
  (`ISL_RULES=1`), compared on 3 evolutionary seeds?

Later, in the panel's order: a learning-slope selection case, permuted-mapping worlds as the
observer's rule, masks as writable channels, next-byte prediction against an n-gram, then a byte
terminal and dialogue.
